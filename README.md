TIHLDE scripts
==============

THILDEscripts is a repo containing the various scripts that TIHLDE uses or has used in the management of its systems.
Be warned that a lot of the scripts have not been adapted for general consumption, and more than a few of them might be broken. Others have are no longer in used but have never been archived.
They also contains the age old signature of being quickly hacked together to just work quickly, not to be pretty or easy to read. Making these public is the first step towards trying to enforce higher quality standards.
A lot of the scripts will also contain Norwegian, although we are planning to make an effort to translate at least all new scripts to English. There will also be a lot of references specific to TIHLDE in email texts etc.

If you want to contribute in some way, feel free to submit a pull request.
